          <p>Translations and interpretation services are key tools to increase accessibility to information. 
          Access to information is especially important in relation to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disaster warnings and disaster response;</li>
            <li>Healthcare, especially treatment options and recovery instructions;</li>

            <li>Environmental justice;</li>
            <li>Workplace safety.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>See how many people speak a particular language in different places.</p>
          <p>Understanding how speakers of a certain language are distributed across the U.S. can help organizations 
          find collaborative partners in creating translations and interpretive services for that language.</p>
          <p>Organizations that serve particular language communities can use this information to identify key service areas.</p>
          <p>This project seeks to make data about languages spoken in the U.S. accessible to decision-makers in social sector enterprises. 
          Key variables for decision-makers include the detailed language spoken, ability to speak English, and potentially age, for 
          organizations that serve specific age groups, e.g., voting-age population, K-12 children, seniors, etc.</p>
          
          <h3>About the Data</h3>
          <p>The data comes from the <a href='https://www.census.gov/' target='_blank'>US Census Bureau</a> 
          <a href='https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs' target='_blank'>American Community Survey</a>, 
          5-year estimates from 2019-2023. This is the most reliable and most recent data available on languages spoken at home in the US. 
          This data is collected using the following questions:</p>
          
          <img src='language_600_q14.avif' width='50%' alt='Language Spoken at Home question on the American Community Survey'>
          
          <p>The US Census Bureau reports 130 language categories, including 105 individual languages (e.g., Spanish, Hawaiian) and 25 aggregated language categories (e.g., Other Malayo-Polynesian languages, Aleut languages).</p>
          <p>Where age information is given, ages were divided into three categories: Youth (age 5-17), Working Age (18-64), and Senior (65-99). 
          Data for individuals under age 5 and above age 99 are not provided by the US Census Bureau.</p>
          <p>Where Ability to Speak English is given, this data is self-reported in part C of the question shown above.</p>
